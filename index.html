  <h1>About Me!</h1>
  <p>Hello! I am BugsEverywhere (Real name Oli), an aspiring musician and programmer currently studying Computer Games Production and the University of Portsmouth, this website is a showcase of some of my projects, this website itself is a project, being a part of my home server that I am learning how to use and manage, so far I have used it to host a minecraft server and this website! As I learn and create more this website will expand into many different pages, but for the moment it is just the one with a brief showcase of my work.</p>
